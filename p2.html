<h1>Benefits of Programming Languages</h1>
	  <p>Each language was designed for a specific purpose otherwise we’d all program in machine language. In fact, the first languages were simple shortcuts into machine language. Then as machines and their applications became more complex so did the languages. BASIC is great for learning, but lacked the power (in most cases) to compete with the likes of COBOL and PL/1. But with the proliferation of PC based computing came a need for more people with wider backgrounds to be able to program. Each new evolution required new elements to the language or ease of use to get the same benefit as the older more esoteric programs of the past. And depending on the complexity of the compiler or even anyone in the company who still knows how it works, it may not be practical to make those improvements. So a niche opens up for a new language to take advantage of a new paradigm: objects need OO and OOP languages. Whatever the next generation will bring will required evolution or replacement by those better equipped to survive.</p>
<p>The benefits of any language are going to be control of the application environment, ease of use, ease of maintenance, scalability and overall robustness, mean time between failures. HTML is great for controlling web pages, but beyond reporting it’s poor at general ledger or payroll. COBOL and RPG (if they even still exist) are great for GL and demand deposit banking, but not very good at running web pages.</p>
